# Railway-Maintenance-LRT
Riderships, Costs and Maintenance of an LRT system
CASEÂ¶
This is a dataset between Mar 2023 - Mar 2024 created by python of a railway LRT information (Dataset is Fictional). The dataset includes how many people riding on the train per day, incedents and maintenance, customer feedback or star rating information, and cost information such as fuel costs and other costs per day. Let's create Exploratory data analysis using python's data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib. After that, we would create a predictive modeling to predict/forecast the ridership (number of passengers using LRT) for the next month using ARIMA Model.
